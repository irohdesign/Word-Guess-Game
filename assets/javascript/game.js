//pseudocode

//create an array for all of the letters to be stored in


//start this function onkeyup
//computer randomly selects a letter



//user enters their letter


//compare the user letter to the computer's letter

    //userGuess === computerGuess => victory

        //make alert to tell them they've won

        //count how many times they've won

    //userGuess !== computerGuess => incorrect (make a shake animation?)
        //make alert to tell them it's wrong

        //count how many guesses left

        //alert when there's no guesses left

        //count how many times they went to 0

//restart the game WITHOUT REFRESH, keeping the losses counter
